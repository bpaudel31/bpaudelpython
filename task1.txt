TASK ONE: NUMBERS AND VARIABLES
1.	Create three variables in a single line and assign different values to them and make sure their data types are different. Like one is int, another one is float and the last one is a string.
>>> x,y,z=10,123.56,'Bikash'

2. 	Create a variable of value type complex and swap it with another variable whose value is an integer.
>>> x=10+2j
>>> type(x)
<class 'complex'>
>>> x=y
>>> y=3
>>> type(x)
<class 'int'>
>>> x
3
>>> y
3
>>>
3. 	Swap two numbers using the third variable as result name and do the same task without using any third variable.
using the third variable
>>> x=10
>>> y=12
>>> z=x
>>> x=y
>>> y=z
>>> x
12
>>> y
10
without using any third variable.
>>> x=45
>>> y=50
>>> x,y=y,x
>>> x
50
>>> y
45
>>>
4. 	Write a program to print the value given by the user by using both Python 2.x and Python 3.x Version.
3.x
>>> x=input("Please enter your Country")
Please enter your CountryUSA
>>> x
'USA'
>>>

2.x
>>> x=input("Please enter your country")
Please enter your country'USA'
>>> x
'USA'
>>>
5. 	Write a program to complete the task given below:
•	Ask the user to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 and add both of them to another variable call z.
•	Use z for adding 30 into it and print the final result by using variable result.
>>> x=int (input("Enter a number between 1-10"))
Enter a number between 1-104
>>> y=int (input ("Enter a number between 1-10"))
Enter a number between 1-107
>>> z=x+y
>>> a=z+30
>>> a
41
>>>
6. 	Write a program to check the data type of the entered values. HINT: Printed output should say -  The input value data type is: int/float/string/etc
>>> x=5
>>> print ("The input value data type is", type(x).__name__)
The input value data type is int
>>> x='Bikash'
>>> print ("The input value data type is", type(x).__name__)
The input value data type is str
>>> x=1234.5
>>> print ("The input value data type is", type(x).__name__)
The input value data type is float
>>>
7. 	Create Variable using CamelCase, LadderCase and UPPERCASE. (Refer:   https://capitalizemytitle.com/camel-case/) - Variable Conventions to write
Can you please explain what a LadderCase is ?
CamelCase 
>>> JungleBook=10
>>> JungleBook
10
lowerCamel
>>> jungleBook="Bikash"
>>> jungleBook
'Bikash'
UPPERCASE 
>>> JUNGLEBOOK=123.45
>>> JUNGLEBOOK
123.45
8. 	If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’ again. Will it change the value. If Yes then Why?

Yes. variable change according to value assigned as it is one of the characteristics of python
>>> x=12
>>> type(x)
<class 'int'>
>>> x="abc"
>>> x
'abc'
>>> type(x)
<class 'str'>
